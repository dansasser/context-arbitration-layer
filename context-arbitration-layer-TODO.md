# TODO: context-arbitration-layer

**Project Directory:** C:\Claude\context-arbitration-layer
**Current Working Directory:** C:\Claude
**Date Created:** 2025-10-25

## Current Context

Working on comprehensive CAL analysis using CAL's own batch patterns (meta-analysis). Running 6 parallel ollama-code processes to understand orchestration depth, dependency architecture, advanced workflows, and multi-executor (claude -p/--agent) emphasis points.

Goal: Incorporate deep analysis findings into SPECIFICATION.md and README.md to enhance implementation guidance and usage documentation.

## Key Findings Summary

### Orchestration Analysis (CAL-001)
- 6 patterns documented with algorithms
- Timing controls specified (global 1500ms, task 500ms)
- Concurrency limits (3-12 configurable, default 5)
- Deterministic execution guaranteed

### Dependency Analysis (CAL-002)
- 5 critical gaps identified
- O(n) complexity documented
- Scalability characteristics defined
- Missing: circular detection, timeouts, partial completion

### Workflow Analysis (CAL-003)
- 6 production-ready patterns
- Concrete bash examples for each workflow
- Cross-session continuity benefits
- Multi-model orchestration patterns

### Multi-Executor Emphasis
- 12 locations identified for updates
- 6 README sections to modify
- 6 SPECIFICATION sections to enhance
- 5 ensemble scenarios with 82-88% token savings

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority:**
   - Populate 3 analysis files (foundation for all other work)
   - Update SPECIFICATION.md technical sections (implementation requirements)

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Update README.md multi-executor emphasis (user-facing clarity)
   - Add ensemble pattern scenarios (demonstrate value)

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Document gaps as "Future Enhancements"
   - Create tutorial documentation

---

## Notes

- All analyses demonstrate CAL's own capabilities (meta-demonstration)
- Token efficiency proven through subprocess delegation
- Findings directly inform both technical spec and user documentation
- Circular dependency detection identified as critical missing feature
- claude -p/--agent support significantly expands executor options
